chmod is for changing PERMISSIONS cuz each file requires its own, for ex.
angel@Michaels-MacBook-Pro intro-python % ./hello.py
zsh: permission denied: ./hello.py
angel@Michaels-MacBook-Pro intro-python % chmod u+x hello.py
angel@Michaels-MacBook-Pro intro-python % 

u+x is add execute permission for the owning user
